# Numerical-Recipes
All header files from numerical recipes. 3rd Edition. 
Note that all these files are under copyright of their authors.

These files have been modified to actually compile, unlike the many copies of these
routines that can be found on Github.
This means that includes and dependencies have been added.

No attempt has been made to make the code more modern or to use C++11 features.
Barely any attempt has been made to clean compiler warnings.
However the routines have been added to the namespace nr3.
This should compile on any modern C++ compiler with C++03 support.
